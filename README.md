## Talk title clichés
You *could* use one of these for the title of your talk, but why not
think of a good name instead?
* X for fun and profit
* X or: how I learned to stop worrying and love Y
* X: the good, the bad, and the ugly
* X considered harmful
* How to X. Not!
* X...like a boss!
* X...FTW!
